# Perka Take-Home Android Code Test

The overall features should be the same as the demo.
There are a bit of interface differences
Drag and Drop re-odering will trigger if you grab the counter name
Deletion will be trigger upon long pressing a counter
Add new counter button is replaced with a floating action button

I used the following 3rd party library
Ormlite - local database
http://ormlite.com/
DragListView - drag and drop re-ordering

Thanks for your consideration. I hope to hear from you soon.
